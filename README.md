# Users-List

***Welcome to my third React project! This is a users list application.***

## Functionality 

1. **You can see the users**
2. **You can see users' info**
3. **You can create a new user**
4. **You can edit an user**
5. **You can delete an user**
6. **You can filter the users by selecting a criteria and use the search bar**(*if the criteria is not selected the search bar has all the criteria*)

## Unsolved Problems
1. **Pagination**
2. **Sorting**

## How to run the project locally on your machine
1. **Download Dependencies**: 
- Open integrated terminal in the client folder:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Server is clear node.js

2. **Run the Server**: Open integrated terminal in the server folder and type:
    ```bash
    node server
    ```
3. **Run the Client**: Open integrated terminal in the client folder and type:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```


## Notes
- The server I used is SoftUni's practice server, not mine.
